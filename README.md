# About STellaris
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can unbiasedly profile molecular signatures of diverse cell types. However, spatial context was lost in dissociation steps, hindering the further interpretation of crosstalk of different cell types that coordinates tissue formation and pathological states. The emerging spatial transcriptome (ST) methods enable measuring gene expression while preserving spatial information. These ST data have the potential to serve as a reference for spatial reconstruction of the ever-growing scRNA-seq data, thereby increasing their value in deciphering the cellular basis of tissue architecture, development and disease.

STellaris is an integrated web application for accurate spatial reconstruction of scRNA-seq, which is founded on a comprehensive compilation of public available ST datasets spanning organs, developmental stages and diseases in human and mouse. With the inferred spatial information of single cells, STellaris will also provide modules to characterize the identification and validation of intercelluar communication, such as cellular colocalization and ligand-receptor interaction.

STellaris also provide an interface to help researchers explore molecular landscape of spatial map in all curated ST datasets, which were processed using a centralized ST workflow. Moreover, we also provide researchers with a gene query interface to access tissue-specific expression profile of genes from the perspective of spatial structure, which was based on deep integration on top of our compiled ST datasets, such as tissue-specific spatially variable genes.

We hope that STellaris will expand our understanding of scRNA-seq at spatial context, especially the spatially resolved cell-cell communication.
